# AGENTS.md

This project is pre-public launch and still under active development, so rapid iteration is preferred over compatibility guarantees. We actively welcome disruptive and even breaking changes if they move the product forward. Careful backward-compatibility work and deep corner-case hardening are not required by default—prioritize shipping fast and learning quickly. We are intentionally pushing limits by combining cutting-edge tools and platforms (e.g., Vercel Sandbox and Gemini CLI) to explore new possibilities. Follow KISS and YAGNI, but stay bold: ship practical, experimental code first, then refine only when necessary.

## llms-full reference

When working on tasks about a library/framework/runtime/platform, first consult
`llms-furl/`, which contains llms-full.txt split into a tree of leaves — small,
searchable files for quick lookup.

Workflow:
1. Check domains in `llms-furl/AGENTS.md`.
2. Search within the relevant domain (e.g. `rg -n "keyword" llms-furl/bun.sh`).
3. If needed, navigate with `index.json` using `jq`.
4. If no relevant info is found, state that and then move on to other sources.

## Source Code Reference

Source code for dependencies is available in `opensrc/` for deeper understanding of implementation details.

See `opensrc/sources.json` for the list of available packages and their versions.

Use this source code when you need to understand how a package works internally, not just its types/interface.

### Fetching Additional Source Code

To fetch source code for a package or repository you need to understand, run:

```bash
npx opensrc <package>           # npm package (e.g., npx opensrc zod)
npx opensrc pypi:<package>      # Python package (e.g., npx opensrc pypi:requests)
npx opensrc crates:<package>    # Rust crate (e.g., npx opensrc crates:serde)
npx opensrc <owner>/<repo>      # GitHub repo (e.g., npx opensrc vercel/ai)
```
