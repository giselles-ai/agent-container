# Fertile Ground — Marketing Page Design Concept

## Concept

**A sandbox is not a cage — it is soil.**

Giselle's lineage is "orchestration" — multiple AIs collaborating and dividing work to produce outcomes. Agent Sandbox extends this by giving orchestration a runtime for "execution."

This page expresses that identity through the metaphor of "Fertile Ground." It references the philosophical concept of the rhizome (a structure with no center, connecting from anywhere, spreading laterally, and generating).

## Metaphor System

All expressions are necessarily derived from this metaphor. What matters is not the "correctness" of each individual item, but that the expression is an inevitable outcome of the Fertile Ground concept.

- **Ground/Soil**: The runtime execution environment itself. The place where agents take root
- **Membrane**: The boundary of isolation. Not a wall, but a living interface that allows what is needed through and connects osmotically with the outside environment
- **Rhizome**: Multi-agent connections. A network that spreads laterally with no center. Connection lines between nodes extend organically, not in straight lines
- **Sow / Tend / Harvest**: Agricultural reframing of Build / Verify / Embed. Sow seeds, check sprouts, harvest fruit

## Language Rules

- **Use generative verbs**: grow, take root, yield, bear fruit, emerge
- **Do not use control verbs**: isolate, restrict, contain, lock, cage
- Terminal-style expressions (code block animations, ASCII art, etc.) are not Giselle's expression. Avoid them
- English copy should be short, starting with verbs. Avoid long explanatory text
- Tone is "Composed confidence" — not "Isn't this amazing?" but the quiet certainty of "This is how it should be"

## Colors

Neither dark nor light — an in-between. The warmth of morning light.

| Token Name | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ground` | `#f5f0e8` | Background. The surface of the soil |
| `ground-deep` | `#ebe4d8` | Background for cards and alternating sections. Slightly deeper soil |
| `soil` | `#2c2416` | Text. A warm brown, not pure black |
| `soil-muted` | `#7a6e5c` | Secondary text |
| `membrane` | `#c9a87c` | Borders, accents. The color of the membrane |
| `membrane-light` | `#e2d2b8` | Thin membrane. Hover states and dividers |
| `root` | `#a08660` | Labels, section names. The color of roots |
| `sprout` | `#8a9a6c` | A subtle green for expressing growth |

## Typography

- **Headings**: Instrument Serif — a serif typeface with warmth and conviction
- **Body**: DM Sans — a humanist sans-serif with warmth
- Headings are large with generous whitespace. Let the power of words carry them

## Visuals

- Rhizome SVG: An organic network of root-like Bézier curves. No straight lines
- Organic shapes rather than geometric grids or terminal UIs
- Framing "10,000 lines → 10 lines": If the soil is rich, a single seed is enough
